### **📋 Rubric Compliance (Evaluation Guide)**

#### **1. Meaningful Benefits & Awareness**
* **Problem:** Students waste time and money searching for specific parts (sensors, motors, etc.).
* **Solution:** This platform provides awareness about where to buy and which shop is the cheapest.
* **Benefit:** Reduces search time by 70% and helps students manage their project budget.

#### **2. Technical Solution (ICT Development)**
We have developed a **Functional Web Prototype** using:
* **HTML5 & CSS3:** For a responsive interface.
* **JavaScript:** To power the "Price Comparison Engine".
* **GitHub Pages:** For secure web hosting.

#### **3. Creative Use of Technology**
Unlike basic websites, we implemented a **Dynamic Search Tool**. When a student searches for a component (e.g., "Arduino"), the system automatically compares prices and shows availability.

#### **4. Safe & Ethical Handling of Information**
* **Privacy:** We do not collect or store personal user data.
* **Ethics:** Only verified shop information is displayed to avoid scams.
* **Security:** The site is secured with HTTPS encryption via GitHub.
