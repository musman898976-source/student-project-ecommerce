# UniProject Market 🎓⚙️

**UniProject Market** is an e-commerce platform specially designed for university students working on academic and engineering projects.  
The goal of this project is to help students easily find required components, compare prices from different stores, and choose the best option without wasting time.

## 📌 Problem Statement

University students often face these issues while working on projects:

- They don’t know where to buy required components  
- Prices vary a lot between stores  
- Product availability is uncertain  
- No single platform for project-based searching  

**UniProject Market solves this problem by providing a centralized platform.**

## 🚀 Project Idea

Students can search by:
- Project name (Arduino Project, Final Year Project, etc.)
- Component name (Sensors, Motors, Bearings, etc.)

The system then:
- Shows available items  
- Compares prices from multiple stores  
- Suggests the cheapest and best option
